# Dark Coordinates

Dark Coordinates is a simple Chrome extension that displays live mouse coordinates in a dark theme and might be useful for some devs. The extension uses a browser action to display the coordinates in a fixed position on the screen, and updates the display in real-time as the mouse moves.

## Installation

To install Dark Coordinates, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Turn on developer mode by clicking the toggle switch in the top-right corner of the screen.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
5. Select the folder containing the cloned or downloaded repository.

The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage

To use Dark Coordinates, simply move your mouse and watch the coordinates display in real-time. The extension updates the display every time the mouse moves, so you can track the coordinates with precision.

If you want to customize the theme or opacity level of the coordinates display, you can open the options page by right-clicking the extension icon in the toolbar and selecting "Options". From there, you can choose between a dark or light theme, and adjust the opacity level with a slider.
